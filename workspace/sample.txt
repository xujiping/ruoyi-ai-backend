This is a sample file in the workspace directory.
You can ask the AI to:

1. Read this file
2. Edit this content
3. Create new files
4. List directory contents
5. Create complete projects

Try asking:
- "Read the sample.txt file"
- "Add a new section to sample.txt about AI capabilities"
- "Create a simple Java project structure"
- "List all files in the workspace"

The AI can perform continuous operations like:
1. First checking what exists
2. Then creating new content
3. Finally verifying the results
